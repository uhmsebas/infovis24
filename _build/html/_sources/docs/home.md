# Introduction

Over the past couple of decades, life expectancy has been increasing among industrialized countries. But if we want to increase it even further, where should we invest the most? In this project, we will research whether education should be at the top of the investment list or if we should invest in a different area, such as vaccines. We will answer this by examining the correlation between GDP, education, vaccines, and life expectancy. The data that is used for this correlation is from Kaggle and the world bank.
