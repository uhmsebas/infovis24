# Reflection
Part of this datastory was our reflection on the project consisting of a peer feedback moment and self reflection. The feedback was received on June 20th, 2024. 

### Peer feedback
After delivering our draft version we received peer feedback by group I1. The peer feedback started with one group giving a quick presentation about their visualizations and their datastory as a draft. After the presentation the group we paired with had to give feedback on what could be improved or overall notions. After which the TAs (technical assistants) would also give us some pointers on what to work on. This process happened on both sides resulting in our group receiving the following peer feedback:
    • Fix quoting of the references, by making them use APA style.
    • Spend time researching the effect of education on other factors, like GDP.
    • Use a wider variety of plots to visualize information.
    • Make the plots more interactive.


### Self reflection
One of the implementations that we wanted to expand on was finding the actual best factor for increasing life expectancy. Unfortunately there are many factors that have an impact on life expectancy, that can't all be discussed in our story, given the time. It is possible there exists external factors that we have missed that had more influence on life expectancy. This resulted in us not being able to give a concrete answer to what has the best effect on life expectancy. However, we did try to research the most relevant factors according to published science. If we had more time we could have incorporated more factors and datasets to find more obvious causations.
