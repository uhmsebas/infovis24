# Work distribution
Our first course of action was to decide what subject we would choose for our project. We did this by presenting different datasets to each other and concluded that we wanted to have it about education and life expectancy. Our second step was to preprocess and merge datasets so we could use them for our plots (see Dataset and preprocessing). While preprocessing we also researched possible correlations and started researching them to determine if they were correlations or causations and thought of the perspectives. After that we made plots and formulated our arguments for our perspectives resulting in our draft version. The remainder of our time we spent on incorporating the peer feedback, refining our arguments, plots and finally uploading the notebook onto the website resulting in our final data story.

**Thijn**<br>
Thijn was responsible for preprocessing the datasets, helping and making the plots. He also attended all the lectures to make sure we did not miss anything vital for the project and helped with the perspectives and arguments. Thijn also made sure the citation was in apa style.

**Leonardo**<br>
Leonardo was responsible for making plots and helping with the issues we had with the website and made text for the work distribution. He also helped with thinking about the perspectives and arguments. Leonardo was also responsible for the github management.

**Luca**<br>
Luca was responsible for formulating the arguments and writing the text around them. He also helped with some plots and researched the correlations to make sure they were causations not correlations and provided the needed research papers for them.

**Sebastiaan**<br>
Sebastiaan was responsible for making plots and making the website work. He was also responsible for the layout of the website and making sure nothing was misplaced on the website.
