# Introduction

Over the past couple of decades, life expectancy has been increasing rapidly among industrialized countries. The question not only begs for how long this trend will continue, but also what factors contribute to such an extraordinarily fast increase. Life expectancy is one of the core statistics that make a nation attractive to live in. This is why it is essential to perform research on what factors contribute to this statistic. An argument can be made that life expectancy is solely based on a nation's level of education, but to what extend is this claim true?

The question whether education should be a top priority of investment or not will be explored in this data story. Using various data visualization techniques, different key factors of countries can be explored to find useful correlations. The data used in these visualizations are taken from [World Data Bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/home), [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy), [WHO](https://immunizationdata.who.int/global?topic=&location=) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amirhosseinmirzaie/countries-life-expectancy).
