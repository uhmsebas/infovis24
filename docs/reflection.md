# Reflection
Part of this datastory was our reflection on the project consisting of a peer feedback moment and self reflection.

### Peer feedback
After delivering our draft version we would receive peer feedback by group i1. The peer feedback started with one group giving a quick presentation about their visualizations and their datastory as a whole. After the presentation the group that you paired with had to give feedback on what could be improved or overall notions. After which the ta’s would also give some pointers on what to work on. This process happened on both sides resulting in our groups receiving peer feedback below:
    • Quoting moet gefixt worden
    • Effect van educatie op andere factoren zoals GDP, sociale kringen, levensstijl etc. (heeft dit vervolgens weer invloed op de levensverwachting?)
    • Variatie in de plots
    • Maak plots meer interactive


### Self reflection
One of the implementations that we wanted to expand on was finding the actual best factor for increasing life expectancy. Unfortunately there are way too many factors that have an impact on life expectancy to confidently say that there is not an external factor that we have missed that had more influence on life expectancy. This resulted in us not being able to give a concrete answer to what has the best effect on life expectancy since it was too time consuming for the span of this project to monitor all factors. If we had more time we could have incorporated more factors and more datasets to confidently at least have a result for the most obvious causations.
